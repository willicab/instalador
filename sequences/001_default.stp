# Default Sequence File
#
####
#
# This file is an example of how sould look like a ".stp" file.
# It's a python list of dictionaries.
#
# The sequence is a python list:
#
#    [step0, step1, step2, step3, ...]
#
# Each step is a python dictionary. The dictionary entries are composed of
# module and method name as the key, and a tuple of parameters for that method
# as the value of the dictionary.
#
#    {"method": parameters}
#
# The "method" name must contain the path to the object we are specting to use,
# for example, if we need "import method from package.module" we call it in the
# sequence like this:
#
#    "package.module.method"
#
# The parameters is simply a tuple of the parameters that the called method
# receives. Here is an example:
#
#    ("A", 'B', [], (), 1, 2.0, True)
#
# If we want to call the above method and pass it that parameter, we must write
# a step in the sequence like this:
#
#    {"package.module.method": ("A", 'B', [], (), 1, 2.0, True)}
